This is a simple console game called "Rock Paper Scissors"

# Explanation

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple game written in **JavaScript**.

The game is played between you and your opponent (which is the computer).
Each round you are prompted to provide an input in the console, chosing between **rock**, **paper** or **scissors**.

The possible outcomes of each round are as follows:

- **rock** beats **scissors**
- **paper** beats **rock**
- **scissors** beats **paper**

In a case where both sides chose the same option the outcome is a **draw**

After the ending of each round the winning side is awarded with 5 points, the side to reach the maximum score of 25 points wins the game.

# How to run and play the game

in order to run and play the game type the following command in your console:

> node rockPaperScissors.js

After the game starts the player has to enter one of the following inputs:

- **rock** or **r**
- **paper** or **p**
- **scissors** or **s**

**Please note that if you provide an invalid input a message will be returned telling you that you've provided an invalid option.**

The computer will then also make his choice and the winner of the round will be revealed.
